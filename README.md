# Kodehode API Assignment

Small Website created for an API assignment during my stay at the Kodehode course/bootcamp in Norway.

After scrolling through the [Github page](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file) of public APIs, I settled on a combo, utilizing two APIs:
- [Chuck Norris IO](https://api.chucknorris.io/#!) to fetch a joke based on the category chosen with the dropdown menu
- [Useless Facts](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl) API from jsph.pl to fetch a random useless fact from their API.


Links/Attribution to the APIs provided at the bottom of the website as well. 
APIs may or may not work in the future depending on whether the API owners change or shut down their APIs.\
